                <td><p>France's magnetic City of Light is a perennial tourist destination, drawing visitors with its iconic attractions, like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and its unmistakable je ne sais quoi. Quaint cafes, trendy shopping districts and Haussmann architecture give Paris its timeless beauty. But the city's best asset is that you're likely to discover something new with each trip or season (read: Paris is always a good idea). To best explore France's ever-changing capital, get lost wandering the charming cobblestone streets, learn its secrets on a walking tour, head to dynamic art exhibits like the Atelier des Lumières or gourmandize at the latest restaurants and pastry shops.</td>

                <td><p>What this 12-square-mile French Polynesian island may lack in size it makes up for in sheer tropical beauty. Here, you'll find picturesque beaches, lush jungles and luxurious resorts set on surrounding islets. The island's extinct volcano, Mount Otemanu, makes for a great photo-op or challenging hike, and the friendly Bora Bora locals can help you catch a glimpse of the island's best sights during an off-road excursion. To relax, head to Matira Beach for crystal-clear water and postcard-worthy white sand. Although a trip to Bora Bora is very expensive, most travelers say it's worth every penny.</p></td>

                <td><p>Snow-capped peaks, alpine meadows and azure lakes are just a few reasons why Glacier National Park is one of America's most striking parks. There are more than 700 miles of hiking trails in this Montana crown jewel, plus 13 designated areas for camping. In the winter, travelers can enjoy snowshoeing and skiing, while during the summer vacationers can go swimming in Lake McDonald and whitewater rafting on Flathead River, among other popular activities. For those who'd rather admire their surroundings from their car, a scenic drive along Going-to-the-Sun Road can't be missed.</p></td>
                
                <td></td>

                <td><p>When you visit Italy's capital city, prepare to cross a few must-see landmarks – including the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon – off of your bucket list. Travelers can also see some of Italy's greatest treasures, including St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, in Vatican City. Escape the tourist crowds by taking a twilight stroll along the cobblestone streets of Trastevere, or head to Mercato Centrale Roma to sample local delicacies like pistachio gelato. Before leaving, peruse some of Rome's lesser-known museums, art galleries and boutiques, or head to Janiculum Hill for panoramic views of the city.</p></td>
